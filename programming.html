				<b>Spotify BPM Playlist Creator</b>
				<p>A Django web app that uses the Spotify API to create playlists with songs from a user's saved tracks with a specified beats-per-minute range.</p>

				<b>Machine Learning on League of Legends Data</b>
				<p>Used machine learning algorithms on League of Legends data to make predictions based on team composition on the outcome of a match. The final product predicted with 70% accuracy the outcome of LoL matches using clustering and classification algorithms on data from 130k matches obtained through the LoL API.

				<b>Stanford Virtual Human Interaction Lab (VHIL)</b>
				<p>Undergraduate programmer in VHIL. Built virtual worlds using Unity and Vizard for use in psychology and sociology experiments as well as lab demos. Also implemented any data analysis scripts that lab researchers needed. This included Python scripts that parsed through gigabytes of positional/rotational data to compute statistics on subjects' movements in a virtual classroom.</p>

				<b>Using Microsoft's Kinect to Generate 3D Object Overlays</b>
				<p>Created 3D visual effects similar to those that users can play with in Snapchat (except this was prior to Snapchat's heyday so Google Hangout's Effects were the real inspiration here). Tracked users in three dimensions with the Kinect and then used the depth data to render an object overlay that reoriented approriately in 3D. Final product was nominated for Best in Class award.</p>

				<b>Piano Fingering Generation with Linear CRFs</b>
				<p>Built a system that, given unfingered sequences of notes, generated fingerings for those notes. The idea was that this system could be used to help beginner piano students learn to play a new piece of music. We decided to use a variable-based model, specifically a chain-structure factor graph called a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF). Our finished system generated physically possible sets of fingerings that were comparable to professionally determined fingerings.</p>

				<b>High Fidelity</b>
				<p>Software engineering intern in High Fidelity's (HiFi's) first intern class. Played with a lot of toys, like the Leap Motion, Oculus Rift, and PrimeSense depth cams, and attempted to integrate them into part of an immersive virtual reality experience. Worked largely in C++ (with OpenNI, OpenGL, and Qt) and got a taste of dealing with graphics/physics in 3D space.</p>
